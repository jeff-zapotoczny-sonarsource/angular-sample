# AngularSample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5 and modified to be a useful example of scanning such a project with SonarQube.

## Usage

Run `build.sh`, which will first use the Angular CLI to run unit tests against the project and then invoke the sonar scanner.

## Development server

If you're curious to see what this sample app does, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
